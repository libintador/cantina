    JM Villa had a plan. He was fresh from studying the culinary arts in Oregon, and all he wanted to do was cook great food and make it accessible to people. These genuine ideals, coupled with some generous help from friends, realized El Chapo at Bob’s Courtyard in Bacolod.

    The menu is a contemporary Tex-Mex mash-up,  which includes fusion cuisine with Negrense ingredients.

    Fast forward to 2021, after everything that has happened, including the pandemic and… wouldn’t it so nice to just grab a taco and sit on a bench as we watch the world burn itself out? Now, El Chapo had resurrected to become The Cantina you know today! Pre-COVID, The Cantina was set up right next to the North Fitness Gym, hence the former name. But since the lockdowns began, the Cantina’s been brought home to JM and his family’s property.

    JM still has that same plan. Just turns out that tacos are tastier with a little improv and when prepared with the family.
